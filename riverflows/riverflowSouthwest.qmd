This report is temporarily disabled because station `Flam` is not reporting discharge data.

```{R}
#| eval: false
# SW flow out of Everglades
stations <- c(
  "BotCr",
  "Flam"
)

param_name <- "Disch"

source("R/plotStationsLine.R")
plotStationsLine(stations, param_name)

source("R/plotStationsStream.R")
plotStationsStream(stations, param_name)
