## TODO:
* map of stations w/ shortname
* discharge watch for series of stations in downstream flow

## NOTES:
999 indicates param is not measured at that location.

## IDEAS:
* **station inspector** : all params at one station
  * lots of time series plots
  * gauges
  * infographic
  * one tab per parameter
* **station comparison** : compare params at multiple stations
  * time series w/ multiple station for one param
  * selected stations shown on map
* **map** : one param value for all stations on a map
  * values encoded in color (and/or size) of points
  * interpolation
  
* **RQ: rainfall impact** : specific focus on rainfall events
  * precip, sal, temp, disch, level, gaugeHeight
* **RQ: dicharge events** : highlight discharge events not related to precip
  * how long does it take to go downstream to FL Bay
    * sat data when it gets there
  * should see more water going to everglades instead of st lucie et al.
  * start: disch for stations in a downstream flow
